title: Attentional Multilabel Learning over Graphs: A Message Passing Approach
---

#### Paper link: [Attentional Multilabel Learning over Graphs: A Message Passing Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00293).
### TLDR
[To be filled.]

### Key Points
- It is very common to test a drug on multiple diseases.
- Treat classes as nodes (termed as **label node**) and include them in to the message passing framework.
    - Therefore, classes also have an associated embedding.
- Hierarchical attention is proposed to deal with large number of classes and huge graph.
- In order to perform well on this task, two correlation structures must be captured
