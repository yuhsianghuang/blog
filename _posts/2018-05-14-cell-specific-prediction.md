#### TLDR;
- Gene expression profiling of **in vitro** drug perturbations is useful for many biomedical discovery applications. 
    - e.g. drug repurposing and elucidation of drug mechanisms. 
- Limited data availability across cell types has hindered our capacity to leverage or explore the cell-specificity of these perturbations. 
- While recent efforts have generated a large number of drug perturbation profiles *across a variety of human cell types*, many gaps remain in this combinatorial drug-cell space.
- Try to fill these gaps by predicting cell-specific drug perturbation profiles using available expression data from related conditions.
