> **De novo**, a term for any method that makes predictions about biological features using only a computational model **without extrinsic comparison to existing data**. 
>> In this context, it may be sometimes interchangeable with the Latin term **ab initio**.

> **In vitro**
>> meaning: in the glass
>> performed with microorganisms, cells, or biological molecules **outside** their normal biological context.
>> Studies conducted using components of an organism that have been **isolated from their usual biological surroundings** permit a more detailed or more convenient analysis than can be done with whole organisms; however, results obtained from in vitro experiments *may not fully or accurately predict* the effects on a whole organism.
>>  In contrast to in vitro experiments, **in vivo** studies are those conducted in animals, including humans, and whole plants.
